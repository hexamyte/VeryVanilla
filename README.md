# VeryVanilla
A very vanilla-esque loot filter for Path of Diablo cobbled together by stea--borrowing ideas from other filters and adjusting them to my taste.

Main Goal: Take many useless items off the screen and make it slightly easier to identify things you might possibly be interested in picking up, from a very casual player's perspective. Avoid turning the screen into rainbow unicorn barf.

Summary of current filter functions: 

Ideas "in process" (in no particular order): 
  - Write basic summary of filter functions.
  - Highlight POD-specific items
  - Fix the gold filters
  - Adjust inferior and "skill-item" (wand, barb helm, etc) filters to hide more skill-items. Item value gates?
  - Add some nice before/after screenshots
  - Hide more normal, no-socket items based on level
